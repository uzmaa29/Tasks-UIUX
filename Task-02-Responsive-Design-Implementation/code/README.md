This project is a responsive front-end webpage built to demonstrate the practical use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating a clean, functional, and device-adaptive user interface. The webpage, titled WebSkills, is designed for students, professionals, and self-learners who want to understand the fundamentals of front-end development and responsive design.

The page uses semantic HTML to structure content clearly, including a navigation bar, hero section, feature highlights, and footer. The layout focuses on clarity, accessibility, and real-world usability. A responsive top navigation bar adapts to smaller screens using a hamburger menu, ensuring smooth navigation across devices.

CSS is used extensively to manage layout, spacing, typography, and responsiveness. Flexbox and Grid are applied to organize the hero section and feature cards, while media queries ensure that the layout adjusts seamlessly for tablets and mobile devices. Visual hierarchy is maintained through consistent spacing, font sizing, and card-based components. The design prioritizes readability and a professional aesthetic.

JavaScript adds interactivity to the webpage. A toggle function controls the mobile navigation menu, improving usability on smaller screens. The “Enroll Now” button triggers a dynamically created modal popup, confirming successful enrollment. This interaction demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic UI feedback without relying on external libraries.

Overall, this project fulfills the objective of implementing a responsive webpage that works smoothly across different screen sizes while maintaining clean design principles and functional interactivity. It demonstrates foundational front-end skills and aligns with real-world responsive web development practices.
