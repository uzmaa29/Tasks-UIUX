## Mobile App UI/UX Redesign – UTS on Mobile

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on redesigning the user interface and user experience of the **UTS on Mobile (Unreserved Ticketing System)** application developed by Indian Railways. The goal of this redesign is to improve usability, navigation clarity, and overall user experience by addressing key pain points identified through UX analysis.

UTS is widely used by daily train commuters across India for booking unreserved tickets. Due to its frequent usage and functional importance, improving its usability can significantly enhance the commuting experience.

## Objective

The objective of this redesign is to:

* Improve navigation structure and usability
* Prioritize important user actions such as ticket booking
* Reduce visual clutter and cognitive load
* Introduce a clear login interface
* Improve overall visual hierarchy and accessibility

---

## UX Research and Problem Analysis

Based on analysis of the existing UTS mobile application, the following usability issues were identified:

### Key Problems:

* Lack of a clear and structured navigation system
* No dedicated login or onboarding interface
* Poor visual hierarchy on the home screen
* Important features such as “Normal Booking” are not prioritized
* Cluttered layout with multiple competing elements
* Inefficient task flow for booking tickets

These issues increase cognitive load and make the app harder to use, especially for first-time and time-sensitive users.

---

## Proposed UX Improvements

The redesign focuses on solving the identified problems through the following improvements:

* Introduction of a dedicated login screen
* Clear and structured home screen layout
* Prioritization of primary user action (Book Ticket)
* Simplified and focused booking flow
* Organized service sections
* Introduction of a bottom navigation bar with 5 core sections:

  * Home
  * Tickets
  * Trains
  * Help
  * Profile

These improvements enhance usability, reduce confusion, and improve task efficiency.

## Design Process

The redesign was completed using the following UX design process:

1. App selection and research
2. UX problem identification
3. UX analysis and pain point definition
4. Low-fidelity wireframe creation (Lo-Fi)
5. High-fidelity UI design (Hi-Fi)
6. Final prototype screens

---

## Screens Redesigned

The following screens were redesigned:

* Login Screen
* Home Screen
* Normal Booking Screen

These screens represent the core user flow of the application.

---

## Tools Used

* Figma (UI/UX design and prototyping)
* UX design principles and usability heuristics

---

## Outcome

The redesigned interface improves:

* Navigation clarity
* Task efficiency
* User confidence
* Visual hierarchy
* Overall user experience

The redesign provides a more modern, intuitive, and user-friendly experience compared to the original application.

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of UX design principles to solve real-world usability problems. By focusing on user needs and simplifying task flows, the redesigned UTS mobile application provides a more efficient and accessible experience for daily commuters.
