## Mobile App UI/UX Redesign – UTS on Mobile

---

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on redesigning the user interface and user experience of the **UTS on Mobile (Unreserved Ticketing System)** application developed by Indian Railways. The goal of this redesign is to improve usability, navigation clarity, and overall user experience by addressing key usability issues identified through UX research and analysis.

The UTS mobile application is widely used by daily commuters to book unreserved railway tickets. Improving its usability can enhance efficiency, reduce confusion, and improve the overall commuting experience.

##  Objective

The main objectives of this redesign are:

* Improve navigation clarity
* Prioritize primary user actions such as ticket booking
* Reduce visual clutter and cognitive load
* Introduce a clear login and onboarding interface
* Improve visual hierarchy and accessibility
* Create a modern and user-friendly interface

---

##  UX Research and Problem Analysis

After analyzing the existing UTS mobile application, several usability issues were identified:

### Key Problems Identified:

* Lack of structured and intuitive navigation
* No dedicated login or onboarding interface
* Poor visual hierarchy on the home screen
* Important features such as Normal Booking are not prioritized
* Cluttered interface with multiple competing elements
* Confusing booking flow
* Lack of clear separation between primary and secondary actions

These issues negatively impact usability, efficiency, and user confidence.

##  Proposed UX Improvements

The redesign introduces the following UX improvements:

* Dedicated login screen for better onboarding
* Simplified and structured home screen layout
* Clear prioritization of primary user tasks
* Organized services and feature grouping
* Simplified and focused booking flow
* Improved visual hierarchy and readability
* Introduction of bottom navigation with 5 core sections:

  * Home
  * Tickets
  * Trains
  * Help
  * Profile

These changes improve usability, navigation efficiency, and overall user experience.

##  Design Process

The following UX design process was followed:

1. App research and analysis
2. Problem identification
3. UX analysis and solution planning
4. Low-fidelity wireframe creation
5. High-fidelity UI design
6. Final screen design and refinement

---

##  Low-Fidelity Wireframes (Lo-Fi)

Low-fidelity wireframes were created to define the layout structure and user flow before visual design. These wireframes focus on functionality, layout, and usability rather than visual appearance.

The following wireframes were created:

* Login Screen Wireframe
* Home Screen Wireframe
* Normal Booking Screen Wireframe

These wireframes helped in planning the user flow and improving the overall navigation structure.

---

##  High-Fidelity Designs (Hi-Fi)

High-fidelity designs were created based on the lo-fi wireframes. These designs include visual styling, colors, typography, and proper visual hierarchy.

Redesigned screens include:

* Login Screen
* Home Screen
* Booking Screen

The high-fidelity design provides a modern, clean, and user-friendly interface.

---

##  Tools Used

* Figma – UI/UX Design and Wireframing
* UX Design Principles and Heuristics

---

##  Outcome

The redesigned interface improves:

* Navigation clarity
* User efficiency
* Visual hierarchy
* Ease of use
* Overall user experience

The redesign provides a more intuitive and modern experience compared to the original application.

---

##  Conclusion

This project demonstrates how UX design principles can be applied to solve real-world usability problems. By simplifying navigation, improving visual hierarchy, and prioritizing user tasks, the redesigned UTS mobile application provides a more efficient and user-friendly experience for railway commuters.
