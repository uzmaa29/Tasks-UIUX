# Original UI Reference

This folder contains screenshots of the original Savana landing page.

## Purpose
- To document the existing user interface before redesign
- To identify usability and layout issues
- To serve as a reference point for comparison

## Observations
- Interface appears mobile-first even on desktop
- Navigation is dense with many visible categories
- Promotional banners compete for attention
- Lack of clear visual hierarchy

These observations informed the UX decisions made in the redesign.
